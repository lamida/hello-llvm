This repo will show the process of exploring [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

Quoting from its homepage. LLVM is the following.
> The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.

Each folder in this repo is the exploration of LLVM.
